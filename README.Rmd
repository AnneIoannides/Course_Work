#Assignment 2
``` {r quick_look, echo=TRUE}
data("anscombe")
dim.data.frame(anscombe)
colnames(anscombe)
head(anscombe)
tail(anscombe)
summary(anscombe)
```

#Assignment 3

```

#Assignment 4 
###Dataframe Setup

```{r data_import, echo = TRUE}
#Here the data (analgesic) are imported from a csv file and structured as a dataframe, called df

df <- read.csv(file="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/analgesic.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

```


###Dataframe Exploration

```{r data_summary, echo = TRUE}
#Data dimensions are defined:
dim(df)

#Column names of df are listed
colnames(df)

#The first six rows of df are listed
head(df)

#The last six rows of df are listed
tail(df)

#Summary statistics (minimum, maximum, lower quartlile, median and upper quartile) for each column of df are listed
summary(df)
```


###Data Tidying

```{r data_tidy, echo = TRUE}

library(tidyr)
#Data are tidied using tidyr from wide to long format
df_long <- gather(df, ID, Group, Measurement_1:Measurement_3)

#Data are manipulated using dplyr
library(dplyr)

#The mean of each individual's measurements is calculated (summarised data)
summary(group_by(df_long, ID))

#The dataframe is printed
print(df_long)
```

#Assignment 5
###Chicken Weights

__Hypotheses__  
_Null Hypothesis:_
No difference exists between the weights  of chickens consuming different feed types  
_Alternative Hypothesis:_
A difference exists between the weights of chickens consuming different feed types  

__Statistical Test Details__  
_Test Statistic:_  
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum rest  
_Assumptions:_  
The errors are independent  
Data are unmatched  
Samples are drawn from populations with the same shape distributions  
Samples are drawn from the population are random  
Observations are independent of each other  
Measured scale for the dependent variable is ordinal  

```{r chicken_weights, echo = TRUE}
chicken_weights <- read.csv(file = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/chick-weights.csv?dl=1", header=TRUE, sep=",")

print(chicken_weights)

#Plot-based exploration
boxplot(chicken_weights$weight ~ chicken_weights$feed)

#Kruskal-Wallis Test
kruskal.test(weight ~ feed,
             data = chicken_weights)

#Post-hoc test with Holm correction
pairwise.t.test(chicken_weights$weight, chicken_weights$feed, p.adjust.method = "holm", paired = FALSE)
```
_Interpretation:_  
The Kruskal Wallis test showed that the weights of the chickens did differ based on their chicken feed (X^2 = 37.343, df = 5, p < 0.0001).   
Post-hoc tests revealed that casein lead to significantly greater weight gain than horsebean (p < 0.0001), linseed (p = 0.0002) and soybean (p = 0.0053) but not meatmeal (p = 0.1823) or sunflower (p = 0.8125).  

Horsebean feed yielded the lowest weight, where weight was significantly lower than meatmeal (p < 0.0001), soybean (p = 0.003) and sunflower (p < 0.0001) but not significantly lower than weights yielded by linseed (p = 0.0944).  

Linseed was only found to have a significantly higher weight gain than horsebean (as reported above) but a significantly lower weight than sunflower (p < 0.0001) but not to meatmeal (p = 0.0944) or soybean (p = 0.5177).  

Meatmeal feed was not not found to influence weight any more significantly than casein, linseed (as reported above), soybean (p = 0.5177) or sunflower (p = 0.1322). Horsebean was found to yield significantly lower weights (as reported above).  

Soybean was found to yield significantly lighter chickens than casein (as reported above) and sunflower (p = 0.003), but significantly heavier chickens than horsebean (as reported above). There was no statistically significant difference between weights of chickens fed linseed or meatmeal compared to soybean.   


###Hot Zone

__Hypotheses__  
_Null Hypothesis:_
No difference between individuals' illness outcomes exists as a consequence of their water consumption  
_Alternative Hypothesis:_
A difference between individuals' illness outcomes exists as a consequence of their water consumption  

__Statistical Test Details__  
_Test Statistic:_    
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test  
_Assumptions:_  
The Odds Ratio is the same in different repeats of the experiment
```{r hot_zone, echo = TRUE}
hot_zone <- read.csv(file = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/gastroenteritis.csv?dl=1", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#I initially printed the raw hot_zone data for view and decided on the data type

#Data are categorical but ordinal in nature, therefore data are cross-tabulated
xtabs(~Outcome + Consumption, data = hot_zone)

#Plot-based exploration of data
#A mosaic plot is elected for best visualisation

hot_zone_exploration <- xtabs(~ hot_zone$Consumption + hot_zone$Outcome)

mosaicplot(hot_zone_exploration)

#Due to the data being ordinal, data are assigned scores (where the vcdExtra package is required)
library(vcdExtra)

#Scores are assigned as 1, 3, 2 (and not 1, 2, 3) as the second column is "> 4 glasses" and the last column is "1 - 4 glasses"
CMHtest(hot_zone_exploration,
        types = "cmeans",
        cscores = c(1, 3, 2))

detach(package: vcdExtra)
```
_Interpretation:_  
The more water consumed by individuals, the more likely they were to become ill (X^2 = 9.8467, df = 1, p = 0.0017).


###Nausea

__Hypotheses__  
_Null Hypothesis:_ No difference exists between nausea ratings before and after consumption of the 5HT3-receptor blocker  
_Alternative Hypothesis:_ A difference between nausea ratings before and after consumption of the 5HT3-receptor blocker exists  

__Statistical Test Details__  
_Test Statistic:_  
Wilcoxon signed-rank test  
_Assumptions:_  
The errors are independent  
Matching is effective  
Samples are drawn from populations with the same shape distributions  

``` {r nausea, echo = TRUE}
nausea <- read.csv(file = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/nausea.csv?dl=1", header=TRUE, sep=",")

print(nausea)

#Plot-based exploration
nausea_exploration <- xtabs(~ nausea$Nausea_before + nausea$Nausea_after)

mosaicplot(nausea_exploration)

library(tidyr)

#nausea_long <- gather(nausea, Nausea_before:Nausea_after)
#print(nausea_long)

library(dplyr)

summary(nausea)

wilcox.test(nausea$Nausea_before, nausea$Nausea_after,
            paired = TRUE)

```
_Interpretation:_  
There is no difference between the nausea ratings in patients before and after they took the 5HT3-receptor blocker (V = 26, p = 0.2906).

#Assignment 6  
###Housing Prices  

__Hypotheses__  
_Null Hypothesis:_  
No relationship exists between the interest rate and the median house price in USD  
_Alternative Hypothesis:_  
A linear relationship exists between the interest rate and the median house price in USD  

__Statistical Test Details__  
_Test Statistic:_ 
Linear Regression

_Assumptions:_   
A linear regression exists between interest rate and the median house price in USD  
Observations are independent (impaired)  
Interest rate is measured without error  
Residuals (distance from the regression line) are normally distributed  
Residuals have the same variance for all fitted values of the median house price (i.e. they are homoscedastic, where no relationship is seen between the interest rate and the size of the residual)

```{r housing_prices, echo = TRUE}
housing_prices <- read.csv(file = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/housing-prices.csv?dl=1", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#I printed the data to see what they looked like
print(housing_prices)

library(ggplot2)

#I used exploratory plots
plot(housing_prices$interest_rate, housing_prices$median_house_price_USD, 
     main = "The Relationship between interest rate and housing prices in USD", 
     abline(lm(housing_prices$median_house_price_USD ~ housing_prices$interest_rate, 
               data = housing_prices, 
               lwd = 3, 
               col = 4)))

#Linear Regression
housing_regression <- lm(housing_prices$median_house_price_USD ~ housing_prices$interest_rate, 
                         data = housing_prices)

summary(housing_regression)

#Appropriate Diagnostic Criteria:
#1. Residuals follow Normal Distribution
qqnorm(housing_regression$residuals,
       pch = 20,
       col = "blue") #Because blue is my favourite colour
qqline(housing_regression$residuals, 
       lwd = 4,
       col = "purple")

#2. Homoskedasticity
plot(x = housing_regression$fitted.values, 
     y = housing_regression$residuals, 
     xlab = "Values", 
     ylab = "Residual values",
     pch = 20,
     col = 4,
     abline(h = 0,
            lwd = 4, 
            col = "green"))

#Plotting the linear model
glm(housing_prices$median_house_price_USD ~ housing_prices$interest_rate,
    data = housing_prices)

```
_Interpretation:_  
A very weak negative correlation exists between interest rate and the median house price (R^2 = 0.2848). However, the correlation is mildly significant (F = 6.947, df = 14, p = 0.0194). Therefore, as the interest rate increases, the median house price mildly decreases.
